# Storybook Baseline Addon

A Storybook addon that shows Baseline compatibility badges for web features used in your stories, helping you make informed decisions about browser compatibility.

## What is Baseline?

[Baseline](https://web.dev/baseline/) is a web standards project that provides information about when web features became stable enough for production use. It helps developers understand which CSS features are safe to use across different browsers.

## Features

- Automatically detects CSS features used in your stories
- Shows whether features are "widely", "newly", or not in baseline
- Clickable links to MDN documentation for each feature
- Clear icons and status indicators in the Storybook toolbar

## Installation

```bash
npm i storybook-baseline
```

## Configuration

Add the addon to your `.storybook/main.js`:

```js
export default {
  addons: [
    'storybook-baseline'
  ]
};
```

## Usage

The addon automatically detects CSS features in your stories and displays their baseline compatibility status. You can also manually specify features using the `baseline.features` parameter:

```js
export default {
  parameters: {
    baseline: {
      features: ['display', 'flex', 'grid', 'container']
    }
  }
};
```
